Dreadfish:
        - Projectile flame burst attack.
        - When projectile on cooldown, come close for melee.
        - When projectile back online, back away from target for distance before firing again.

        - Instead tamed by hitting them with fire resistance while they're burning from sunlight.
        - Their passive movement needs to stay close to the ground. Not too high up.
        - Spawn in cold biomes as usual, but increase spawns in icy biomes.
        - Particles need to look better!
        - Make dreadfish size a bit bigger.

        Beetle:
        - Passive unless in super close proximity.
        - If attacked, they turn truly hostile and don't regard the super close range rule.
        - Can not be tamed if angry.
        - They eat honey blocks on the ground, which acts as their healing mechanic. It's slow albeit balanced, since instant healing on the go would be pretty crazy.
        - While untamed, they still eat honey blocks. This cancels the agro range and allows the player to saddle them. Saddling them while they're like this will tame them. (if player is null then the next entity to ride them takes ownership.)
        - Beetle will not follow owner akin to a horse. It will however protect the owner as a wolf would.
        - Beetles can never be armoured or anything, but the soon to be added war paint will be applicable to a beetle.

        - One of the two bred beetles will lay an egg block shortly afterwards.
        - Egg block soon births a grub. Slow, fat and cute(hopefully).
        - Grub eventually turns into a super tanky pupa stage. Entirely devoid of most AI.
        - Pupa soon becomes an adult beetle. Life cycle for these things is intentionally slow.

        Lunar Moth:
        - Make them a bit larger, and make them follow better AI.
        - Land on solid light blocks for a time and hover around non-solid ones.
        - Light is how they heal.
        - Make them much more active albeit productive on a full moon.
        - Surfaces they land on accrue glow-dust, which can be fashioned into many glowy things and can also be used to dupe glowstone dust.
        - They go to sleep during the day, looking for a low light block to rest against.
        - Not tameable, but like to hover close if the player is holding a light emitting block which makes it easier to bottle them.
        - Breedable by giving them some sugar during a full moon.
        - One of the bred pair lay eggs on the surface of a block, which soon becomes a couple of caterpillars. Those caterpillars soon grow to a pupa, which then becomes a moth.
        - Either code that caterpillars can crawl on walls and roofs, make caterpillars climb walls slowly and decend slowly while near one, or make moths only lay their eggs on the tops of blocks.
